ideas for proper way to handle start/stop/defrost (and any other modes)

HP.mode's:
- stop
- stopping
- emergencyStop
- start
- starting
- run
- cooling
- heating
- defrost
- afterDry (drying coil with hpFan)
- error


HP.program's:
- idle
- heatToWater (w/o ahu)
- coolingAir (w/ ahu)
- heatingAir (w/ ahu)
- heatingCHG (TBD, with hp or only hpFan)

4-way:
- heating
- cooling



-----
problem is now how we handle defrost.. never heal to normal process

core problems:
- defrost is triggered more than once
- STOPPING_DEFROST not stops defrost loop properly, HP.timeoutHandlers.defrost2 interval continues
